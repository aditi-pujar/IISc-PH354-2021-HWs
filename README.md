# IISc-PH354-2021-HWs
Solutions set to the assignment problems I did as a part of the Computational Physics course during Spring 2021 at IISc. The instructors for the course are Prof. Prabal Maiti and Prof. Prateek Sharma (Physical Sciences Div., IISc).

The problems are from many different areas of physics and cover a wide range of computational techniques. The primary reference textbook is Mark Newman's 'Computational Physics'.
